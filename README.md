# my-neovim-config

My Neovim config using NvChad includes a debugger, linter, LSP, and formatter for Rust and C++. Build the code (it must have debug symbols). For debugging using CodeLLDB, set a breakpoint by typing SPC db and start debugging by typing SPC dr. In COMMAND mode, type the path to the .exe file, and debugging will start. If you are in Cargo.toml, type SPC rcu to upgrade crates to their current versions.
